# calculator_mini_project

I have created the basic structure for the calculator webpage as requested. The HTML file (index.html) includes two input boxes for numbers, four buttons for the operations (+, -, ร, รท), and a result display area. The CSS file (index.css) provides basic styling for layout and appearance.

Still there is a futher development which i will do as i learn js
